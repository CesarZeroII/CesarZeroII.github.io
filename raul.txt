"What exactly is the meaning of this?!" Lieutenant José said, dropping the report on the table.

"It's as it says there, sir! Captain Raul has perhaps died!" The soldier said.

"Yes, I read literally the only thing it says in the report! What happened to him?!" He shouted.

"There is a possibility he is no longer alive." The soldier clarified. "Isn't it tragic, sir?"

"Well, of course our leader, annoying as he may be naming random things after me, dying would be tragic, 
but what on earth do you mean when you say he 'perhaps' died?!" He snapped.

"Well, sir, you see, there is a non-zero chance that Captain Raul, at this moment, has ceased all major bodily functions." The soldier elucidated.

"But what are the details?! What did you find out about his disappearance?! Why did I get a 'report' that just says 'perhaps he died'?!"

"Quizás se murio." The soldier added, speaking in their native language for the first time for some reason.

"You know what, screw this." The Lieutenant shot the soldier, killing him instantly. "I guess there is a chance Raul himself will come clarify this."


RAUL - PERHAPS END
